        <div class="text-card">
            For our P33 project we teamed up with M1 to bring awareness to and teach about an economic issue that many people face.
            <br><br>
            Many potential electric car owners are scared off by the high initial cost compared to gas cars. What we want to teach is
            that owning an electric vehicle is a long-term investment, and over time the economic benefits become more apparent.
            <br><br>
            Our goal became to create a Java program that shows long-term ownership costs, along with this website to teach
            important facts about electric vehicles.

                The most common <b>Electric Vehicle</b> is a <b>Battery-Electric Vehicle (BEV)</b>, which runs entirely on electricity.
                <br><br>
                <b>Hybrid vehicles</b> combine electric motors with gasoline engines.
                <b>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)</b> can be charged by plugging in, while
                <b>Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV)</b> recharge using the gasoline engine.
